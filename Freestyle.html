<h2>What is the technique for freestyle? </h2>
<div class="content">
<p><strong>The technique for freestyle can be a bit intimidating for beginners. Freestyle is also called the front crawl. When you swim freestyle
you are on your stomach and your face toward the water while your arms and legs pull your legs through the water.
First, your arm arcs out while your other arm stays in the water. Your fingers are held together and straight.
Your legs will be moving in a tight scissor-like movement under the water, like a flutter kick. Even though your knees will be bent slightly, your legs
must remain parallel to the surface of the water all the time. For freestyle you must keep your head down which might be a bit scary for beginners but adding a breath to freestyle is very easy.
As one arm comes out of the water you turn your face to the side and take a breath. </strong></p>
