<p><strong>Backstroke is the mirror of Freestyle. You do not have to worry about breathing because like the name says you are going to
swim on your back which is easier to breathe than freestyle. </strong></p>
<h2> What are the techniques for backstroke?</h2>
<p><strong>For backstroke you must face the roof or the sky (depending on if your pool is an indoor pool or an outdoor pool.)
One arm will come up of the water and go over your head, while the other arm comes upward in the water.
You will be alternating this movement. Your arms must be close to your ears as they come down into the water after it goes over your head.
You will want for your arms to be as straight as they can go and close your fingers. Also, try not to keep your hips from drowning in the water.
Make sure to keep your head looking at roof or the sky cause if you try to look at your legs or to your side as it can slow you down. While your arms pull you through the water your legs will be doing the same scissor-kick that you do in freestyle.
Like I said earlier you do not need to worry about breathing because your face is looking upward.  </strong></p>
<h3> What are the benefits of backstroke?</h3>
<p><strong> By swimming backstroke, you will burn about 250 calories (about 20 minutes of running) in 30 min.
Backstroke can help you improve your posture of your back since your muscles will work to keep your back straight.
It can also improve your hip flexibility and like other strokes work your arm, leg, and core muscles. </strong></p>
