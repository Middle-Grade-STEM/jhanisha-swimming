<p><strong> Breaststroke is the easiest stroke to begin with if you are new to swimming. It is also a slow stroke which means you do not have to be too fast. </strong></p>
<h2> What are the techniques of breaststroke? </h2>
<p><strong> For breaststroke, your body will be in the same horizontal position as freestyle. Your arms will be move together at the same in half-circular motion under the water.
Your arms first will be in the gliding position. Then, your arms will bend at the elbow, then sweep apart and then toward your chest. While doing this with your arms your legs will be doing the frog kick.
For the breaststroke kick your knees will bend and your feet flexed, you kick your legs apart and then sweep them together again to keep them in one straight line.
Lastly, to breathe you breathe as the arms pull down and your head rises above the surface of your water </strong></p>
<h3> What are the benefits for breaststroke? </h3>
<p><strong> When you swim breaststroke for every 30 minutes, you will burn about 200 calories (about 16 minutes of running).
Breaststroke is the easiest stroke to learn and you do not have to worry about breathing as you can do this stroke without putting your head in the water.
Like the other strokes, this stroke works particularly good for chest muscles and your hamstring. Your thigh, core and arm muscles will also get better from breaststroke.
As the breaststroke is slow, this stroke can work well if you are doing an endurance workout. </strong></p>
